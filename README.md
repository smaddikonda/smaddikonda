# Hello
I love crafting software, for there is not a field more fascinating to me than software development. 
My philosophy is simple, to build software with passion and purpose.
I have been developing software professionally for the past 4+ years, and have an overall coding experience of 10+ years, using multiple programming languages and paradigms.
I'm passionate about building scalable, performant, distributed, data-intensive, full-stack software applications, which are intuitive and user-centric on the front-end, and robust and reliable on the back-end.
I am quietly confident at the work I do, innately curious, an eternal seeker of knowledge, and improving my finesse everyday, one day at a time.
