# Hi there!
I love crafting software, for there is not a field more that's fascinating to me than software development. My programming philosophy is simple: to build software with passion and purpose.

I have been developing software professionally for the past 5+ years, and have an overall coding experience of 11+ years, using multiple programming languages and paradigms.

I'm passionate about building scalable, performant, distributed, data-intensive, full-stack software applications, which are intuitive and user-centric on the frontend, and robust and reliable on the backend.

I'm quietly confident at the work I do, innately curious, an eternal seeker of knowledge, and I'm improving my finesse everyday, one day at a time.
